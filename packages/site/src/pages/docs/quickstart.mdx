# Stream Blitz

Stream Blitz is a service designed to make adding sound effects to your Twitch™ streams feel like deploying serverless functions.

> ⚠️ This product is still in alpha. If you’d like to be added as an alpha tester, please contact <jason@lengstorf.com>.

## How it works

1. Join Stream Blitz
2. Create a serverless handler
3. [Deploy to Netlify](https://netlify.com/?utm_source=twitch-blitz-jl&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=devex)
4. Run your sound effect!

### Creating a Stream Blitz serverless handler

1.  Install the serverless handler util

    ```bash
    # install the handler util
    yarn add @stream-blitz/create-handler
    ```

2.  Create a serverless function:

    ```js
    const createHandler = require('@stream-blitz/create-handler');

    exports.handler = createHandler(() => ({
      name: 'boop', // command to trigger this effect in chat, e.g. `!boop`
      message: 'you triggered !boop Kappa', // sent to the chat by Stream Blitz
      description: 'Information about the command', // shown in Stream Blitz
      audio: 'https://example.org/path/to/sound.mp3', // played in your overlay
      image: 'https://example.org/image.gif', // shown in the overlay
      duration: 10, // how long (in seconds) to show the overlay
    }));
    ```

    Note: only `name` is required — the rest of the fields are optional and will be omitted if left out (e.g. you can send a chat message without an overlay and vice versa)

3.  Register your serverless function

    Visit your [Stream Blitz dashboard](/) to pull in your effects!
